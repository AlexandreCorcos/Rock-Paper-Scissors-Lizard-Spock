## Rules
* Rock crushes Scissors

* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock

### Implementation Details
The game is implemented in Python and uses a simple console interface. The random module is used to generate the computer's move.
